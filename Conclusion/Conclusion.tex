\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this experiment, we have observed the Zeeman effect in the red line of the cadmium spectrum. We have also measured the magnetic field strength and current relationship, and observed the linearity of the Zeeman shift with respect to the field strength. Finally, we have measured the $\frac{e}{m}$ relationship, finding the value to be within two uncertainty intervals, suggesting that our measurements of the Zeeman effect were a success. However, although we confirmed the linear polarization of the light viewed perpendicular to the magnetic field, we were not able to confirm the circular polarization of the light viewed parallel to the field.
